This is my capstone project on comparing how region affects NBA performance

There are two components to this code, first is the Capstone.py, to run that program you just need to make sure you have the packages installed
You will also need to make sure you import the leaguegamelog from the nba api

After you have all the correct packages and api imported the code will be able to run

The other component is the additional method that we branched off to out of curiosity
the averagedistance.py calculates the average total distance traveled per season and compares it to its win percentage.
You will need the regular_season_totals_2010_2024 data set to run this as well as all the packages installed.
